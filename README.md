# Banking-Management-system
The Banking System Application is a user-friendly program designed to manage essential banking operations through a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the Windows API in C. This application enables users to create new bank accounts by providing an account number, name, and password, with all account information securely stored in a file called `accounts.dat`. Users can view a list of all existing accounts, displaying details such as account numbers, names, and current balances. The application supports financial transactions, allowing users to deposit or withdraw money from their accounts, with each transaction updating the account balance and logging the activity. Users can check their account balances, update their account passwords, and view their transaction history, which includes the date, type of transaction (deposit or withdrawal), and the amount involved. Additionally, the application provides the option to delete accounts, ensuring that users have full control over their banking data. The application features a straightforward interface with buttons and input fields for performing these operations, and it includes robust validation and error handling to ensure secure and accurate transactions. Overall, this application serves as an excellent educational tool for demonstrating file handling, basic GUI development, and fundamental banking logic in C.
